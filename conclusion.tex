In this paper, we have presented LM, a new linear logic programming language designed with concurrency in mind. LM is a bottom-up logic language
that can naturally model state due to its foundations on linear logic.
We presented several LM programs that show the viability of linear logic programming to solve interesting graph-based problems.

We also gave an overview of the formal system behind LM, namely, the fragment of linear logic used in the language, along with the high level and low level dynamic semantics.
While the former is closely tied to linear logic, the latter is closer to a real implementation. The low level dynamic semantics can be used as a blueprint for someone that
intends to implement LM.
