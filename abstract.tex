We have designed a new logic programming language called LM (Linear Meld)
for programming graph-based algorithms in a declarative fashion. Our language
is based on linear logic, an expressive logical system where logical facts can
be consumed. Because LM integrates both classical and linear logic, LM tends
to be more expressive than other logic programming languages.
LM programs are naturally concurrent because facts are partitioned by nodes
of a graph data structure.
Computation is performed at the node level while communication happens
between connected nodes.
In this paper, we present the syntax and operational semantics of our language
and illustrate its use through a number of examples.
