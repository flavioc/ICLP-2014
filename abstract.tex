There is an increased interested in executing graph based algorithms concurrently.
Systems such as Pregel~\cite{Malewicz:2010:PSL:1807167.1807184} or GraphLab~\cite{GraphLab2010}
are specialized frameworks for programming and
executing algorithms over graph structures. Although these frameworks make it significantly easier to write
those kinds of programs, they tend to have a steep learning curve because they use low level languages
such as C++. We have designed a logic programming language for programming graph based algorithms
in a high level fashion. 
Logic programming is a form of declarative programming that uses proof search as a computation
mechanism. Logic based languages use logical clauses to drive computation, which makes them
be both easier to write and to reason about.
Since our language is based on linear logic, a powerful logical system where logical facts can be removed,
our programs tend to be more expressive than in other logic programming languages.
Programs are mapped to an underlying graph structure where sequential computation is performed at the node level
and communication takes place when nodes send facts to each other.
We have implemented several search algorithms and machine
learning algorithms and have seen good scalability results on multicore machines.
