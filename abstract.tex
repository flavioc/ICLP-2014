Due to the popularity of social networks and the internet, there has been an increased interested
in executing graph based algorithms concurrently. Systems such as Pregel~\cite{Malewicz:2010:PSL:1807167.1807184}
or GraphLab~\cite{GraphLab2010} are specialized frameworks for programming and executing algorithms
over graph structures. Although these frameworks make it significantly easier to write those kinds
of programs, they tend to have a steep learning curve because they use low level languages such as
C++. We have designed a logic programming language for programming graph based algorithms in a declarative
fashion. Logic based languages raise the programming abstractions because they use logical clauses to drive computation, which makes
them be both easier to write and to reason about. Since our language is based on linear logic, a
powerful logical system where logical facts can be removed, our programs tend to be more expressive
than in other logic programming languages. Programs are mapped to an underlying graph structure where
sequential computation is performed at the node level and communication takes place when nodes send
facts to each other. We have implemented several search algorithms and machine learning algorithms
and have seen good scalability results on multicore machines.
