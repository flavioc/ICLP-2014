We have designed a new logic programming language called LM (Linear Meld)
for programming graph-based algorithms in a declarative fashion. Our language
is based on linear logic, an expressive logical system where logical facts can
be consumed. Because LM integrates both classical and linear logic, our programs
tend to be more expressive than other logic programming languages. Programs are
mapped to an underlying graph structure where computation is performed at the node
level and communication takes place when nodes send facts to each other. LM programs
are thus naturally concurrent because facts are partitioned by nodes of a graph data
structure. In this paper, we present the syntax and operational semantics of our language
and illustrate its use through a number of simple examples.
