Due to the popularity of social networks and the explosion of the content available in the World Wide Web, there has been
increased interest in running graph-based algorithms concurrently. Most of the available concurrent frameworks are implemented as libraries on top
of imperative programming languages, which require knowledge of both the library and the interface, making it difficult
for both novice and expert programmers to learn and use correctly.
Reasoning about the programs requires knowing how
the library schedules execution and the operational semantics of the underlying language.

Some good examples are the Dryad, Pregel and GraphLab systems.
The Dryad system~\cite{Isard:2007:DDD:1272996.1273005} is a framework that combines computational vertices
with communication channels (edges) to form a data-flow graph. Each program is scheduled to
run on multiple computers or cores and data is partitioned during runtime. Routines that run on computational vertices
are sequential, with no locking required.
The Pregel system~\cite{Malewicz:2010:PSL:1807167.1807184} is also graph-based, although programs have a more strict
structure. They must be represented as a sequence of iterations where each iteration is composed of computation and message passing.
Pregel is aimed at solving very big graphs
and to scale to large architectures. GraphLab~\cite{GraphLab2010} is a C++ library for developing parallel machine learning algorithms. While
Pregel uses message passing, GraphLab allows nodes to have read/write access to different scopes through different concurrent access models in order to balance performance and data consistency. While some programs only need to access the local node's data, others may need to update edge information. Each consistency model provides different guarantees that are suited to different classes of algorithms. GraphLab also provides different schedulers that dictate the order in which node's are computed.

An alternative promising approach for graph-based algorithms 
is logic programming. For instance, the P2 system~\cite{Loo-condie-garofalakis-p2}, used Datalog to map nodes of a computer network
to a graph, where each node would do computation locally and could communicate with neighbor nodes.
Another good example is the Meld language, created by
Ashley-Rollman et al.~\cite{ashley-rollman-derosa-iros07wksp,ashley-rollman-iclp09}, which was designed to
program massively distributed systems made of modular robots with a dynamic topology. Meld was itself inspired
in the P2 system because it is based on the graph model of computation but adapted to the concept of moving
robots.
Logic-based systems are more amenable to proof since a program is just a set of logical clauses.

In this paper, we present a new logic programming language called LM (Linear Meld) for concurrent programming over graph structures designed to take advantage
of the recent architectures such as multicores or clusters of multicores. LM is based on the Meld language, but differs from other logic programming languages
such as Datalog or Prolog in three main aspects. First, it integrates both classical
logic and linear logic into the language, allowing some facts to be retracted and asserted in a logical fashion. Second, unlike
Prolog, LM is a bottom up logic programming language (similar to Datalog) since the database is updated incrementally as rules are
applied. Third, LM is a language created to solve general graph-based algorithms, unlike P2 or Meld which were designed for more specific domains.

In the following sections, we present the syntax and semantics of our language and explain how to write programs that take advantage of its expressive power. We identify three key contributions in our work:

\begin{description}
   \item[Linear Logic:] We integrate linear logic into the original Meld language so that program state can be encoded naturally.
   Meld started as a classical logic programming language where everything that is derived is true until the end
   of the execution. Linear logic turns logical facts into resources that will be consumed when a rule is applied. In turn, this makes it possible to represent program state in a natural, safe and declarative fashion.
   \item[Concurrency:] LM programs are naturally concurrent because facts are partitioned by vertices of a graph data structure. While the original Meld sees graphs as a network of robots, we see each node as a member of a distributed data structure. This is made possible due to the restrictions on derivation rules, which
only use local facts, residing at a node, or communicate with neighboring nodes.
   \item[Semantics:] Starting from a fragment of linear logic used in LM, we formalize a high level dynamic semantics that is closely related to this fragment.
   We then design a low level dynamic semantics and sketch the soundness proof of our low level
   semantics with respect to the high level language specification. The low level specification
   provides the basis for an efficient implementation of LM.
\end{description}

To realize LM, we have implemented a compiler and a virtual machine that executes LM programs on multicore machines
\footnote{Source code is available at \url{http://github.com/flavioc/meld}.}. We also have a preliminary version that runs on networks by
using OpenMPI as a communication layer. Our experimental results show that LM has good scalability.
Several interesting programs were implemented such as belief propagation~\cite{Gonzalez+al:aistats09paraml},
belief propagation with residual splash~\cite{Gonzalez+al:aistats09paraml}, PageRank, graph coloring,
N queens, shortest path, diameter estimation, map reduce, game of life, quick-sort, neural network training, among others.
While these results are evidence that LM is a promising language, this paper will only focus on the more formal aspects of our work.
