Developments in parallel and distributed programming have given birth to several programming models.
At the end of the spectrum are lower-level programming abstractions such as
\emph{message passing} (e.g., MPI~\cite{gabriel04-open-mpi}) and \emph{shared memory}
(e.g., Pthreads or OpenMP~\cite{Chapman-2007-UOP-1370966}).
While such abstractions are very expressive and enable the programmer to write very performant code,
they tend to be very hard to use and debug due to synchronization problems.
On the other hand, we have many declarative programming models such as logic or functional programming
that can be run in parallel~\cite{Blelloch:1996:PPA:227234.227246} and tend to be easier to write.

Due to the popularity of social networks and the explosion of the content available in the World Wide Web, there has been
increased interest in running graph based algorithms in a distribution fashion. The sheer size of
the available datasets makes it impossible to run such algorithms in a single machine.
Most of the available frameworks developed for these kinds of algorithms are implemented as libraries on top
of imperative programming languages and thus require knowledge of both the library and the interface, making
the learning curve steep for unexperienced users. In turn, reasoning about the programs requires knowing how
the library schedules execution and the operational semantics of the underlying language.

Logic programming is a promising approach to implement graph based algorithms since it is a declarative paradigm
and is less prone to the problems found in imperative programming languages.
The P2 system~\cite{Loo-condie-garofalakis-p2}, for example, used Datalog to map nodes of a computer network
to a graph, where each node would do computation locally and could communicate with neighbor nodes.
This kind of programming is more amenable to proof since a program is just a set of logical clauses.

We have designed a new logic programming language called LM (Linear Meld) that attempts to run graph based
algorithms in more traditional architectures such as multicores. LM is based on the Meld language created by
Ashley-Rollman et al~\cite{ashley-rollman-iclp09,ashley-rollman-derosa-iros07wksp}, which was designed to
program massively distributed systems made of modular robots with a dynamic topology. Meld was itself inspired
in the P2 system because it used the same graph based model of computation but adapted to the concept of a moving
robot.

LM differs from other logic programming languages such as Datalog or Prolog for three reasons. First, we integrate both classical
logic and linear logic into the language, allowing some facts to be retracted and asserted in a logical fashion. Second, unlike
Prolog, LM is a bottom up logic programming language (similar to Datalog) since the database is updated incrementally as rules are
applied. Third, LM is a language created to solve general graph based algorithms, unlike P2 or Meld which aimed to solve domain
specific problems.

In this paper we want to present the syntax and semantics of our language, explain how programs can be written
and what novel ideas LM brings to the table. We identify three key contributions of our work:

\begin{description}
   \item[Linear Logic:] We integrated linear logic into the original Meld so that program state can be encoded naturally.
   Meld started as a classical logic programming language where everything that is derived is true until the end
   of the execution. Linear logic turns some logical facts into resources that will be consumed when a rule is applied. In turn, this makes it possible to represent program state in a natural and declarative fashion.
   \item[Distribution:] LM programs are naturally concurrent because facts are partitioned by vertices of a graph data structure. While the original Meld sees this graph as a network of robots, we see each node as a logical part of the program (for example, in the graph coloring algorithm, the vertex is the node of the graph we want to color). This is made possible due to the restrictions on derivation rules, which are only allowed to use facts from a single vertex.
   \item[Semantics:] Starting from a fragment of linear logic used in LM, we formalized a high level dynamic semantics that is closely related to this fragment.
   We then designed a low level dynamic semantics that is a blueprint for a low level implementation of LM. It is very
   close to our implementation and helped us during development. We also explain how we proved the soundness of our low level semantics.
\end{description}

To realize LM, we have implemented a compiler and a virtual machine from scratch that executes LM programs on multicore machines
\footnote{Source code is available at \url{http://github.com/flavioc/meld}.}. We also have a preliminary version that runs on networks by
using OpenMPI as a communication layer. Our experimental results show that LM has good scalability.
Several interesting programs were implemented such as belief propagation~\cite{Gonzalez+al:aistats09paraml},
belief propagation with residual splash~\cite{Gonzalez+al:aistats09paraml}, PageRank, graph coloring,
N queens, shortest path~\cite{Dijkstra}, diameter estimation, map reduce, game of life, quick-sort, neural network training, among others.
While these results are evidence that LM is a promising language, this paper will only focus on the more formal aspects of our work.
We next present the related work and then we give an overview of our language and some concrete programs.
